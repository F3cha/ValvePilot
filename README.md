## ValvePilot
is an irrigation valve controller designed to manage up to three solenoid valves using MOSFET transistors and a 9V dual power supply. This project is ideal for automating small-scale irrigation systems, such as gardens, greenhouses, or landscaping setups.
Features

    -Controls three independent valves efficiently
    -Uses MOSFETs for precise and reliable switching
    -Powered by two 9V sources, ensuring stable operation
    -Compact and easy to integrate into existing irrigation systems
    -Compatible with microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP, etc.) for smart automation

Perfect for DIY enthusiasts, gardeners, and automation projects looking to streamline water management. ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§
