## ValvePilot ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§
is an irrigation valve controller designed to manage up to three solenoid valves (you can increase the number if you have enough digitalpins) using MOSFET transistors and a 9V dual power supply. This project is ideal for automating small-scale irrigation systems, such as gardens, greenhouses, or landscaping setups.
